## Additional questions
---
1. How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

==It took about ~10 hours. The features can be countless, but I would expand it by using other endpoints on the API.==

2. What alternative approaches/solutions to the user story did you consider when engineering your solution? What benefits/downsides would they have had compared to the selected solution?

==I thought of adding data comparison between different districts so that the care manager could compare its status with others.==

3. What additional features/improvements do you think could help the customer gain more value from your application?

==I would add a timeline noting feature which makes users able to add notes on different dates, though this can take time to create.==

4. Where do you see issues in your code that might cause issues in the future? How would you monitor the performance of your app?

==Fetching data from the remote source might be problematic if the connection is not perfect or the Api data structure is changed, a data caching setup can be helpful in case of failure on receiving data.==

5. How would you improve the API that you just used or its documentation?

==I think the API is perfect, though the documentation can have more explanation on the endpoints to make it clear.==

6. What did you think about this test? How interesting was it for you? How would you recommend us to improve the test?

==In overall, it is quite good for both the developer to challenge himself and the company to assess the abilities of applicant.==
